# TypeLinker
**Important Note:** This project will be changing name soon. The original naming didn't adequately explain at a glance what the project does and while it may be superficial (to an extent) I believe this change will make it easier to understand what's going on. The core files have already been refactored for this change. Once the related article is updated the repo name will be updated simultaneously.

A type dictionary that enables non-structural type constraints in Typescript.
